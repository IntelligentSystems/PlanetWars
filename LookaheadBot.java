/** Another smarter kind of bot, which implements a minimax algorithm with look-ahead of two turns.
 * It simulates the opponent using the BullyBot strategy and simulates the possible outcomes for any
 * choice of source and destination planets in the attack. The simulated outcome states are ranked by
 * the evaluation function, which returns the most promising one.
 * 
 * Try to improve this bot. For example, you can try to answer some of this questions. 
 * Can you come up with smarter heuristics/scores for the evaluation function? 
 * What happens if you run this bot against your bot from week1? 
 * How can you change this bot to beat your week1 bot? 
 * Can you extend the bot to look ahead more than two turns? How many turns do you want to look ahead?
 * Is there a smart way to make this more efficient?
